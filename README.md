Statistics for Data Science and Machine Learning (IBM - Coursera)

Welcome to my project repository!
This repo documents my learning journey through the Statistics for Data Science and Machine Learning course offered by IBM on Coursera.

ðŸ“š What I Learned
Throughout the course, I covered a broad range of fundamental and advanced statistical concepts, including:

Descriptive Statistics
Summarizing and interpreting data using measures like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

Data Visualization
Creating meaningful visualizations to explore and communicate insights (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.).

Probability Distributions
Understanding distributions like Normal, Binomial, and Poisson, and applying them in practical scenarios.

Hypothesis Testing
Formulating and testing hypotheses using different statistical methods.

p-Values and t-Tests
Applying t-tests to compare sample means and understanding the significance through p-values.

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
Comparing means across multiple groups to detect significant differences.

Regression Analysis
Using statsmodels to perform linear regression and interpret model outputs.

ðŸ›  Final Project
As a capstone project, I applied the concepts learned to a comprehensive statistical analysis task.
The project involved:

Exploring a dataset
